Basic Graph Terminologies 
---
| Term    | Definition     |
|-----|---------|
| **Graph (G)**        | A collection of `vertices (nodes)` and `edges (links)` that connect pairs of vertices.      |
| **Vertex (Node)**    | A fundamental unit of which graphs are formed, usually represented as a dot or circle.                     |
| **Edge (Link)**      | A connection between two vertices in a graph.                                                              |
| **Directed Graph**   | A graph in which edges have a direction, going from one vertex to another.                                 |
| **Undirected Graph** | A graph in which edges do not have a direction, meaning they can be traversed both ways.                   |
| **Weighted Graph**   | A graph in which edges have associated weights, typically representing costs, distances, or capacities.     |
| **Adjacency List**   | A way of representing a graph by listing each vertex and its adjacent vertices.                            |
| **Adjacency Matrix** | A 2D array representation of a graph where the cell at row i and column j indicates the presence of an edge.|
| **Degree**           | The number of edges incident to a vertex.                                                                  |
| **In-Degree**        | The number of edges directed into a vertex in a directed graph.                                            |
| **Out-Degree**       | The number of edges directed out of a vertex in a directed graph.                                          |
| **Path**             | A sequence of vertices where each adjacent pair is connected by an edge.                                   |
| **Cycle**            | A path that starts and ends at the same vertex, with all edges and vertices being distinct except for the endpoints. |
| **Connected Graph**  | A graph in which there is a path between every pair of vertices.                                           |
| **Disconnected Graph** | A graph in which at least one pair of vertices does not have a path connecting them.                     |
| **Complete Graph**   | A graph in which there is an edge between every pair of vertices.                                          |

|--------|--------------|------------------|
| **Definition**    | Traverses the graph level by level, exploring all neighbors of a vertex before moving to the next level. | Traverses the graph by exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. |
| **Steps**         | 1. Initialize a queue and mark the start vertex as visited. <br> 2. Enqueue the start vertex. <br> 3. While the queue is not empty: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;a. Dequeue a vertex. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;b. Visit all its unvisited neighbors, mark them as visited, and enqueue them. | 1. Initialize a stack and mark the start vertex as visited. <br> 2. Push the start vertex onto the stack. <br> 3. While the stack is not empty: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;a. Pop a vertex from the stack. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;b. Visit all its unvisited neighbors, mark them as visited, and push them onto the stack. |
| **Time complexity** | ùêé(V+E) |  ùêé(V+E) |
| **Applications**  | - Finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. <br> - Level-order traversal of a tree. <br> - Finding connected components in an undirected graph. | - Topological sorting of a directed graph. <br> - Solving puzzles and games (e.g., maze solving). <br> - Finding strongly connected components in a directed graph.  |
