Basic Graph Terminologies

| Term    | Definition     |
|-----|---------|
| **Graph (G)**        | A collection of `vertices (nodes)` and `edges (links)` that connect pairs of vertices.      |
| **Vertex (Node)**    | A fundamental unit of which graphs are formed, usually represented as a dot or circle.                     |
| **Edge (Link)**      | A connection between two vertices in a graph.                                                              |
| **Directed Graph**   | A graph in which edges have a direction, going from one vertex to another.                                 |
| **Undirected Graph** | A graph in which edges do not have a direction, meaning they can be traversed both ways.                   |
| **Weighted Graph**   | A graph in which edges have associated weights, typically representing costs, distances, or capacities.     |
| **Adjacency List**   | A way of representing a graph by listing each vertex and its adjacent vertices.                            |
| **Adjacency Matrix** | A 2D array representation of a graph where the cell at row i and column j indicates the presence of an edge.|
| **Degree**           | The number of edges incident to a vertex.                                                                  |

Shortest paths of a weighted graph
---
- Each edge of a `weighted graph` has an associated numerical value, called a `weight`
  - These weights often represent costs, distances, or any other metric that `quantifies the relationship` between the connected vertices
- Weighted graphs can be either directed or undirected
- In the `shortest path between two vertices`, `the sum of the weights` of its constituent edges is minimized

Pseudo code for Kruskal's Algorithm
---
```c++
procedure Kruskals(Graph g):
  initialize a disjoint set with all vertices in g
  initialize an edge set MST
  initialize a priority queue with all edges in g

  while (queue is not empty && MST has edges fewer than n-1)
    dequeue edge between vertices v,w
    if (v and w are not in the same set):
      add edge to MST
      merge v's set with w's set in the disjoint set structure
    end if
  end while
end procedure
```

üèÉ Application: Solve The Nine Tail Problem 
---
![nine tail problem](./images/nine.png)

- Nine coins in a 3x3 matrix 
  - some face up and some face down
- legal move
  - reverse a H together with its adjacent neighbors (no diagonally adjacent) 
- goal
  - find the minimum number of moves that lead to all T
- model the problem with a directed graph
  - each state represented by a node
    - all T is the target node $t$
    - starting state node $s$
  - $u\rightarrow v$ means there is a legal move change $u$ to $v$
  - turn the problem to 
    - find the shortest path from $s$ to $t$ in a BFS tree rooted at $t$

- The number of the flips as the weight on each move
