Binary Trees vs. Binary Search Trees
---
| Feature | [Binary Tree]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree)) | [Binary Search Tree (BST)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree) |
|---------|-------------|--------------------------|
| **Illustration** | ![bt](./images/bt.png) | ![bst](./images/bst.png)  |
| **Definition** | A tree data structure where each node can have `at most two children` nodes. | A binary tree in which for each node, all elements in its `left subtree` are `less` than the node, and all elements in its `right subtree` are `greater than` the node. |
| **Node Insertion** | Nodes are inserted without any specific order. | Nodes are inserted according to their values, maintaining the BST property. |
| **Node Lookup/Search** | No specific order; full tree traversal may be needed to find a node. | Efficient lookup using the binary search property, reducing the search space by half at each step. |
| **Time Complexity (average case)** | $O(n)$ for insertion, deletion, and search. | $O(h)$ for insertion, deletion, and search, where h is the height of the tree. |
| **Space Complexity** | $O(n)$ as it only depends on the number of nodes in the tree. | $O(n)$ as it only depends on the number of nodes in the tree. |
| **Application** | Used in various tree-related algorithms and data structures. | Ideal for applications where efficient search, insertion, and deletion are required, such as in databases and dictionaries. |


Full Binary Tree vs. Complete Binary Tree
---
| Feature  | Full Binary Tree   | Complete Binary Tree   |
|-----|------|-------|
| **Illustration** | ![fbt](./images/fbt.png) | ![cbt](./images/cbt.png) |
| **Definition** | A binary tree where every node has either `0 or 2 children`. | A binary tree in which all levels are `completely filled except` possibly `the last`, which is filled `from left to right`. |
| **Node Properties** | Each node has exactly two children or none.  | Each level, except the last, is completely filled. Nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. |
| **Shape**  | Can be skewed if nodes only have one child direction, but still requires each node to have two or no children. | Tends to be more balanced as it fills from left to right.  |
| **Height**  | Height can vary. The minimum height is $\log(n+1)-1$.  | Height is minimized. The tree is as compact as possible.|
| **Examples**  | A tree with nodes having 0 or 2 children, like expression trees. | A binary heap is a complete binary tree and used in heap sort. |


The insert, delete, and search operations in a BST
---
| Operation | Description | Time Complexity | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Insert** | Inserts a new node with a specific value. The new node is always inserted at a leaf. | Average: $O(\log n)$<br>Worst: $O(n)$ | The tree starts from the root and the new node is inserted on the left if it's smaller than the current node, or on the right if it's larger. |
| **Delete** | Removes a node with a specific value. This can involve replacing the node with its `in-order successor or predecessor` if it has two children. | Average: $O(\log n)$<br>Worst: $O(n)$ | After deletion, the properties of the BST must be maintained. |
| **Search** | Looks for a node with a specific value. | Average: $O(\log n)$<br>Worst: $O(n)$ | Starts from the root and traverses left or right depending on whether the value is smaller or larger than the current node. |
